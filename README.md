# Green Earth Vision — Community Task Hub

Welcome. This repository is the **shared execution space** for Green Earth Vision projects.

This is where work is organized, explored, proposed, and carried out — collaboratively and transparently.

---

## What This Space Is For

This repository exists to:
- Organize real work that needs to be done
- Make it easy for contributors to see what’s needed
- Allow people to self-select areas they want to help with
- Coordinate progress without confusion or gatekeeping

This is **not** a discussion forum or a decision-making authority.  
Decisions are handled through agreed processes outside this repo.  
This is where **execution lives**.

---

## How Work Is Organized

All work is tracked as **Issues**.

Each Issue represents:
- A task
- An exploration
- A draft
- Or a defined piece of work that contributes to the broader mission

Issues are tagged with labels so they’re easy to navigate.

### Current Labels
- `tech`
- `tech-ai`
- `social-media`

(Additional labels may be added over time.)

You can filter Issues by label to focus on areas you’re interested in.

## How to Get Involved

If you’re interested in contributing:

1. **Browse the Issues**
   - Look through open Issues
   - Filter by labels that match your interests or skills

2. **Select One or More Items**
   - You’re free to explore ideas
   - You don’t need to commit yet

3. **Submit a Short Proposal**
   Before starting work, please send a brief proposal outlining what you plan to do.

   You can submit your proposal by:
   - Email: **info.greenearthvision@gmail.com**
   - Or by referencing the Issue(s) here and including a summary

---

## Proposal Outline (Simple)

Your proposal does **not** need to be formal. A few clear points is enough:

- Which Issue(s) you’re interested in
- What you plan to do
- Estimated scope or timeline (rough is fine)
- Any tools, access, or support you may need

Once reviewed and approved, you’ll be given the green light and any resources required.

---

## After Approval

Once approved:
- You can begin work on the Issue
- Progress updates can be shared directly on the Issue
- Completed work will be reviewed and integrated
- Outcomes may later be summarized into reference documents elsewhere

---

## Notes

- You don’t need to take on everything — small, focused contributions are welcome
- This space supports collaboration across experience levels
- Clarity and communication matter more than speed

If something is unclear, ask. If you see a gap, note it.  
This is a living workspace.

Thank you for being here and for contributing your time and skills.
